# Programming-in-Java---Project
A Movie Recommendation System worked with Java
ntroduction to Movie Recommendation System in Java
This project is a movie recommendation system built using Java that utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their previous ratings. The system is designed to be user-friendly and provides a command line interface for interaction. The movie data used by the system is stored in a CSV file, and the system implements both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms to make recommendations. If you are interested in contributing to the project, feel free to contact me for files and guidelines.
