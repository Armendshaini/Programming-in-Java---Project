A Movie Recommendation System worked with Java
This code provides a basic implementation of a movie recommendation system that allows users to search for movies by genre or rating. The code uses Spring Boot for the web application and JUnit for unit testing. The application uses an in-memory repository for storing the movie data, but this could be replaced with a database if needed.
